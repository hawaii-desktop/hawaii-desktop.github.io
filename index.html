                Hawaii is a lightweight Linux-based operating system, a suite of software that makes your computer run.
                It uses the Hawaii Shell desktop workspace. You can use the Hawaii operating system to replace or to
                run alongside of other operating systems such as Microsoft Windows™ or Mac OS X™ although it's not
                currently considered as stable as other operating systems, if you feel brave enough you can be an
                early adopter and let us know of glitches and bugs and help us make a great product.

                <p>
                    The Hawaii Project is a meritocratic, consensus-based community interested
                    in developing the Hawaii system. We believe in the power of Open Source,
                    Free Software and worldwide collaboration as we want to build, share and
                    improve software together and make it available to everyone.

                <p>
                    Hawaii aims to offer an excellent user experience with its desktop environment.
                    Instead of forcing you to know every detail of your computer we expect you
                    to turn it on, sit down and just use it.

                <h2>Advanced Technologies</h2>
                <p>
                    Hawaii was born to take advantage of QtQuick, Wayland and systemd.
                    Therefore it features a dynamic, flicker free and fast system.

                <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
                <p>
                     Hawaii was made to look and behave great on every form factor.
                     The user interface is adapted to the needs of the device it is running
                     on, this means that while on desktops you have more elements and
                     a layout optimized for mouse and keyboard interaction, on mobile you
                     can use applications that adapts to the screen resolution and are
                     designed for touch.
