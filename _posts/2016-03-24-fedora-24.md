Starting from Fedora 24 you will be able to install the Hawaii desktop
environment with a simple dnf command.

<!-- more -->

Typing the following command will install Hawaii on an existing Fedora 24
installation:

```sh
sudo dnf install @hawaii
```

It's also possible to install a new Fedora system with Hawaii selecting
the appropriate group from Anaconda.

Hawaii packages were available in previous version too but the group was never
created and will make things easier.

Fedora now has the first snapshot of Hawaii 0.7.0 packages, but if you want
a more fresh version you should use the [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/plfiorini/hawaii-nightly/)
repository that supports up to Fedora rawhide, including Fedora 24.
