Starting from Fedora 24 you will be able to install the Hawaii desktop
environment with a simple dnf command.

<!-- more -->

Typing the following command will install Hawaii on an existing Fedora 24
installation:

```sh
sudo dnf install @hawaii
```

It's also possible to install a new Fedora system with Hawaii selecting
the appropriate group from Anaconda.

Hawaii packages were available in previous versions too but the group was never
created before. It will make the desktop installable with a single command
without going through the list of dependencies.

Fedora now has the first snapshot of Hawaii 0.7.0 packaged, but if you want
a more fresh version you should use the [copr](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/plfiorini/hawaii-nightly/)
repository that supports up to Fedora rawhide, including Fedora 24.

Nightly packages incorporate all the latest features and bug fixes, given that 0.7.0 is not
out yet you have more chances to get fresh stuff with those packages.
