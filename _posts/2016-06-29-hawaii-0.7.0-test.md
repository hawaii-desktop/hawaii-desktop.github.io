Hawaii 0.7.0 is around the corner, in order to test the new packages
more easily the ISO images for 64 bit PCs were now updated.

The new version is expected in early July.

<!-- more -->

Test images are regularly updated and can be found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hawaiios/files/snapshots/)
until the release comes out.

You can report issues on the general [bug tracker](https://github.com/hawaii-desktop/hawaii/issues).

Live images have two users: "root" and "liveuser" both without password.
At the graphical login prompt just hit Enter to log in as "liveuser".

Remember that you can also test on virtual machines with QEMU with QXL and VMware,
unfortunately VirtualBox does not support Wayland reliably at the moment.
