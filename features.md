# Open Source

Open Source is collective power in action, the power of a worldwide community
that build, share and improve the software together and then make it available
to everyone. We want to make a system that is easy to use and give our users
the best out of the box user experience. This is only possible thanks to the
worldwide Open Source community, because experts all over the world make a
little piece of technology available to others.

# The Stack


## Workspace

We offer an excellent user experience with Hawaii.

Instead of forcing you to know every detail of your computer we expect you to
turn it on, sit down and just use it.

It’s not the kind of Linux distribution you tried before.
Instead of including a plethora of different desktop environments,
Hawaii has only one made to overcome the boundaries of the current solutions.

Hawaii the desktop environment, has a balanced settings policy, between the
minimalist approach where almost no preferences are available and the
highly-customizable approach where every single detail can be changed.

Sane defaults for the needs of most users will make you feel at home.

The "shell" is modular, this means we can create variants optimized for
the device you are using. A "shell" optimized for the desktop will be the
first choice available, but we plan to make a tablet shell available as well.

As the technology we are using will be widely adopted our applications and
third-party's will have a different UX experience for both desktop and mobile
devices (some projects like Snowshoe are already doing it).

We pay attention to the details in order to offer you the most exciting user
experience possible.

Hawaii was born to take advantage of what Qt, QtQuick, Wayland and systemd offer.

## Wayland

Wayland is the most exciting piece of technology for the Linux graphics stack in
years and Hawaii is the first Linux distribution to use it, in fact Hawaii couldn't
be done without it.

Wayland provides a method for compositing window managers to communicate directly
with applications and video hardware, its goal is a system where every frame is
perfect, where applications are able to control the rendering enough that users
won't see tearing, lag, redraw or flicker.

## Qt

Qt is an application development framework based on C++ and has been chosen to
implement the desktop environment and applications. Over 450,000 developers in
more than 70 industries have chosen Qt to build advanced applications and devices.

It's available as a SDK that aims at maintaining binary compatibility through
minor releases, this means your applications will run on previous versions of
Hawaii and developers won’t need to rebuild the bundles for every minor release
of the operating system.

The shell is built using QtQuick, a collection of technologies that are designed
to help developers create intuitive, modern, and fluid user interfaces.

It includes QML, a CSS & JavaScript like language to ease the development of
dynamic and modern applications.

QtQuick applications rendering is fully hardware accelerated and designed to
run at 60Hz and is synchronized with VSync in order to avoid tearing, lag and flickering.

Qt Creator is a cross-platform IDE (integrated development environment) tailored
to the needs of Qt developers. It focuses on providing features that help new
Qt users get up and running faster, and also boost the productivity of
experienced Qt developers.
